# Operating Context

TODO -- needed this definition while writing roles

Examples of an operating context would be `global` (e.g. commands that you run in the global namespace -- creating a user,
resetting your password, listing projects, etc), or `project` (e.g. commands that you run within the context of a project -- 
getting a project policy, adding contributors, etc)
